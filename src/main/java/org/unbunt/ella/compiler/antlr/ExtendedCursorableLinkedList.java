     * <code>close()</code> method. Calling this method immediately discards the

     * The cursor enables iteration and list changes to occur in any order without
     * invalidating the iterator (from one thread). When elements are added to the
     * list, an event is fired to all active cursors enabling them to adjust to the
     * change in the list.

     * When the "current" (i.e., last returned by {@link java.util.ListIterator#next}
     * or {@link java.util.ListIterator#previous}) element of the list is removed,
     * the cursor automatically adjusts to the change (invalidating the
     * last returned value such that it cannot be removed).

     * The {@link #listIterator()} method returns the same as this method, and can
     * be cast to a <code>Cursor</code> if the <code>close</code> method is required.
