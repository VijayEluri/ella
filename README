Ella - An interpreter for the EllaScript programming language

Usage
=====

This EllaScript interpreter requires a Java 6 Runtime Environment to run.
It was tested with the Sun JDK 1.6.0 only.

Unix/Linux
----------

A shell script, called "ella", for running the interpreter can be found
in the "bin" directory.

This defaults to starting in interactive mode when no filename is given
and standard input is a TTY.

Running "ella -h" gives a help message.

Other Systems
-------------

The Ella interpreter can also be run directly by executing the provided
JAR file, "Ella.jar", to be found in the "dist" directory.

This way, when no filename is given, the script to be run is read from
standard input. Interactive mode has to be activated explicitly via the
"-i" command line switch.

Running "java -jar Ella.jar -h" gives a help message.
